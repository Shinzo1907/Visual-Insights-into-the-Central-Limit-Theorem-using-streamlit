# **"Visual Insights into the Central Limit Theorem"**

## Parameters

- **Population Size:** Total number of individuals in the population (100 to 100,000).
- **Sample Size:** Number of individuals in each sample (10 to Population Size).
- **Number of Samples:** Total number of samples to draw from the population (10 to 1,000).

## Application Walkthrough

### Population Statistics

- **Population Mean:** Displays the mean of the generated population.
- **Population Standard Deviation:** Shows the standard deviation of the population.

### Sample Statistics

- **Mean of Sample Means:** Calculates and displays the average of the sample means.

### Graphical Demonstration

- **Histograms:** Combined histograms of the population and sample means with density plots for better visualization.
- **Mean Lines:** Vertical dashed lines marking the population mean and the mean of sample means.

## Explanation

The Central Limit Theorem is a cornerstone of statistics. This application illustrates how, as the number of samples increases, the distribution of the sample means tends to follow a normal distribution, even if the original population distribution is not normal.
